# BadmintoneerIOSApp
• What is the application? 
Badmintoneer is an app that aims to motivate and help new and returning players familiarize with the 
sport by utilizing useful training methodologies found in the web, condensing the information into 
interactive and engaging activities for easy learning. The app will also act as an online platform for 
badminton players to exchange training tips and ideas socially. Badmintoneer follow three important 
steps; Learn, Practice and Play, which is incorporated into the app’s training design. 

• What does the application do? (Key Functionalities)
The app will contain two main features, Training and Social. Once a player enters the pre-training page, 
they will be brought to a page for self-learning where the user has access to three sources: 
Fundamentals, Videos and Court rules, catered to the selected skill level. Skill levels will be separated 
into three levels: novice, intermediate and advanced. Before a novice user can access practical training, 
the user must read the Fundamental section in the pre-training page first. This is because the system 
treats any new novice user as someone that is completed new to the sport. However, a user can choose 
to train in any category that best suit their skill level at any given time.
The parameters of novice training are locked to recommended levels, only users that have selected
either the intermediate or advanced category has the option to choose between preset parameters. This 
is important so that novice players has a good grasp on the basic movements and patterns before 
moving onto more advanced techniques. The core of Practical training is image training; the user must 
imagine what kind of shots and movements the opposing imaginary player is making as the system 
prompts the user to move. The system is designed to limit Practical training according to skill level, as 
Image training becomes ineffective the less inexperienced a player is.
The actual Practical training simulates a 2D court to practice footwork and racket swinging, separated 
into 6 sections, e.g., front-left, mid-right, back-left etc. The system will prompt the player to move to the 
designated spot with both visual and audio. Since the player most likely has his hands and eyes full while
training, the player will be relying more on the audio for the training.
The main feature of the Online Discussion is the sharing feature, where players will be able to post links 
from established platforms such as Facebook and Meetup to organize social games externally. The 
Online Discussion will also be separated into different categories so that users will be able to focus their 
topics e.g., Banter, Rackets & Shuttlecocks etc.

• What is the purpose of the application? 
Badminton is not a sport as popular as other racket sports in non-Asian countries e.g., Tennis or Table 
Tennis, as it is still looked upon as a casual sport. Even though Badminton became an official sport in the 
1900s, it is still buried beneath mainstream sports. The goal of this app is not only to connect other 
badminton players, but to create a network that can continuously grow into a larger community
independently, ultimately spreading the knowledge of the sport by being the hub of social games.

Badminton is not an easy sport; there is much training and skills required to play it on a decent level. By 
breaking down the process and making it a convenient service for users to experience, Badmintoneer
hopes to convince people that Badminton deserves the recognition it should have.

• How does the application serve its target audience?
Badmintoneer converts badminton training into personalized and private lessons that can be done at 
the user’s own leisure. There are numerous free but valuable training regimes and lessons posted in 
articles or videos in many different platforms. By combining the techniques and converting them into a 
portable format set, users will be able to gain access to training anytime and fit it easily into their 
schedule. By combining a social feature into the app, users will be able to transit from solo training to 
actual games with other people on court.
